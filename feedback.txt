Ideas to improve the traffic sign classifier:

Accuracy:


- ensure the distribution of samples across different classes is well balanced
- augment the training data with image processing techniques (shifts, brightness adjustments, etc.)
to create more diverse examples for the model to learn from
- increase the number of convolution or fully connected layers in your network 
- use batch normalization


Visualization
- To further explore the data, you can also display a few images for each of a few traffic sign classes
to get a sense of how they vary within the class.
